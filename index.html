              <h1>From Bootstrapping to Building a Brand that Scales</h1>
              <h2>All the lessons we learnt along the way.</h2>
              <p>Back in 2013, Sébastien, my brother Romain and I decided to launch a coding school to teach creative and entrepreneurially-minded people how to code their own tech products through <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/program" target="_blank">an intensive 9-week bootcamp</a>. At that time, none of us had real design or branding skills. My brother was a lawyer. Sébastien and I were both engineers (French engineers, aka the worst kind in terms of design background 😬).</p>
              <p>We only knew one thing: we wanted to build a program to teach people the technical skills and tools to bring their ideas to life. This program would go far beyond “becoming a full-stack developer” or “learning UX/UI Design, HTML, CSS, ruby and Javascript”. For us, these skills were also a prerequisite for anyone who wanted to develop tech projects autonomously in their current job, start a freelancing career or launch their own startup. And we felt that traditional degrees’ courses were failing to provide students with these new tech skills. As we say in French…</p>
              <h2>🇫🇷 L’éducation supérieure a “un wagon de retard”…</h2>
              <p>An idiom that could be literally translated into: “Higher education has missed the train”. This was the first time we thought of the word “wagon” for our brand name. After giving it some more thought, it seemed like a cool name for different reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>It points to this idea of a “missing block” or “missing wagon” in the “train of higher education”.</li>
                <li>A wagon is a vehicle that takes a group of people (like a class of students) on a journey to a destination. This is exactly what our coding bootcamp is about!</li>
                <li>We didn’t want a brand name using words like “hack”, “code”, “tech”, “app”, etc… For us, code is a means to develop products and reach your goals, not an end in itself.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>So, Le Wagon it was! Vive Le Wagon!</p>
